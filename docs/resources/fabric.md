## Schema

### Required

It includes configurations for IP address allocation pools, network topology roles (Leafs, Spines, SuperSpines, BorderLeafs), inter-switch links, and network protocols (underlay and overlay). The specification allows for detailed control over routing strategies, including ASN allocations for BGP-based protocols, and supports advanced features like BFD.

- `name` (String) name of the Fabric
- `namespace` (String) the namespace scope in which to operate
