### Optional

- `alarms` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--alarms))
- `api_version` (String)
- `deviations` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--deviations))
- `kind` (String)
- `name` (String) name of the IslPing
- `namespace` (String) the namespace scope in which to operate
- `status` (Attributes) The result of the ISL ping (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))
